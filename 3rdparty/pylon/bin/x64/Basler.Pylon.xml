The group mask is a bit mask that allows sending an action to a subgroup of the cameras addressed by the device and group key. The result of a bitwise AND operation of groupMask and the group mask stored in a camera for an action must be non-zero for executing an action.
</param>
            <param name="broadcastAddress">
The broadcast address in dot notation where the command will be broadcast to, e.g., 255.255.255.255 (all adapters, default), 192.168.1.255 (all cameras in a single subnet 192.168.1.xxx), 192.168.1.38 (single camera). See the note below.
</param>

The action command feature lets you trigger actions in multiple cameras at roughly the same time or at a defined point in time (scheduled action command) by using a single broadcast protocol message (without extra cabling). Action commands are used in cameras in the same way as, for example, the digital input lines.

If a Microsoft Windows operating system is used, sending a broadcast out on multiple network interfaces 
is executed sequentially for each interface. That's why additional latency is added to the execution time 
of a command when sending a broadcast message over a wider broadcast address range than necessary, e.g., when using
the broadcast address 255.255.255.255. </remarks></member>

           &lt;b&gt;Default (Unicast)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           The camera sends stream data to a single controlling application. Other devices cannot
           receive the stream data.
       &lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;br&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;
           &lt;b&gt;Broadcast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           The camera sends the stream data to all devices on the network. The application which 
           starts/stops the acquisition is called the controlling application. Other applications
           can receive the stream data. These applications are called monitor applications, because 
           they open the camera in read-only mode. This implies that monitor applications cannot 
           change the camera configuration and they cannot start/stop the image acquisition.
           However, monitor applications can request resend requests for lost stream data packets.
           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           Attention: Broadcasting the stream data packets uses a high amount of network bandwidth 
                      because the stream data packets are forwarded to all devices attached to the 
                      network, even if they are not interested in receiving stream data.
       &lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;br&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;
           &lt;b&gt;Multicast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           Multicasting is very similar to broadcasting. The main advantage of multicasting is that 
           multicasting saves network bandwidth, because the image data stream is only sent to those 
           devices that are interested in receiving the data. To achieve this, the camera sends image 
           data streams to members of a multicast group only. A multicast group is defined by an IP 
           address taken from the multicast address range (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255). 
           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           Every device that wants to receive a multicast data stream has to be a member of a multicast 
           group. A member of a specific multicast group only receives data destinated for this group.
           Data for other groups is not received. Usually network adapters and switches are able to filter
           the data efficently on hardware level (layer-2 packet filtering). 
           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           When multicasting is enabled for pylon, pylon automatically takes care of joining and leaving 
           the multicast groups defined by the destination IP address. Keep in mind that some addresses
           from the multicast address range are reserved for general purposes. The address range from
           239.255.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 is assigned by RFC 2365 as a locally administered address space.
           Use one of these addresses if you are not sure.
           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           On protocol level multicasting involves a so-called IGMP message (IGMP = Internet Group Management Protocol).
           To benefit from multicasting, managed network switches should be used. These managed network 
           switches support the IGMP protocol. Managed network switches supporting the IGMP protocol
           will forward multicast packets only if there is a connected device that has joined the
           corresponding multicast group. If the switch does not support the IGMP protocol, multicast
           is equivalent to broadcasting.
           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           Recommendation:&lt;br&gt;
           &lt;ul&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;
                   Each camera should stream to a different multicast group.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;
                   Streaming to different multicast groups reduces the CPU load and saves network bandwidth 
                   if the network switches supports the IGMP protocol.
               &lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;/ul&gt;
       &lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;br&gt;        
       &lt;li&gt;
           &lt;b&gt;Use camera configuration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           This setting is only available if the application has opened the device in monitor mode. If 
           the controlling application has already configured the camera stream channel and has possibly 
           started the acquisition, the monitor application can read all required configuration data 
           from the camera. Additional configuration is not required. This setting can only be used if 
           the controlling application has established the stream channel (by opening a pylon stream 
           grabber object), and the monitor application is started afterwards.
           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           Note, when using broadcast and multicast configurations: When there is more than one camera 
           device reachable by one network interface, make sure that for each camera a different port
           number must be assigned. For assigning port numbers, see the 'DestinationPort' feature.
       &lt;/li&gt;

           The camera will send all stream data to this port. If you manually enter a port
           number, it is highly recommended not to choose a port from the ephemeral port
           range of the operating system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port)
           in order to avoid port collisions.

           &lt;b&gt;Port configuration:&lt;/b&gt;
           &lt;ol&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;
               &lt;b&gt;Unicast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
               The port is determined automatically.
               Manually choosing a port number might be useful for certain firewall configurations.
           &lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;br&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;
               &lt;b&gt;Broadcast &amp; Multicast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
               For each device reachable by a specific network interface, a unique, unused port number
               must be assigned. Be aware that the suggested default value might be already in use.
               Choose an unused port or 0=autoselect in that case. The controlling application and all 
               monitor applications must use the same port number. There is no autoselect feature
               availbale for monitor applications, i.e., monitor applications must not use the 0 value.
               For monitor applications it is convenient to use the 'UseCameraConfig' value for the 
               'TransmissionType' feature instead. For more details see the 'TransmissionType' feature.
           &lt;/li&gt;

           &lt;b&gt;Default (Unicast)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           The camera sends stream data to a single controlling application. Other devices cannot
           receive the stream data.
       &lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;br&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;
           &lt;b&gt;Broadcast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           The camera sends the stream data to all devices on the network. The application which 
           starts/stops the acquisition is called the controlling application. Other applications
           can receive the stream data. These applications are called monitor applications, because 
           they open the camera in read-only mode. This implies that monitor applications cannot 
           change the camera configuration and they cannot start/stop the image acquisition.
           However, monitor applications can request resend requests for lost stream data packets.
           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           Attention: Broadcasting the stream data packets uses a high amount of network bandwidth 
                      because the stream data packets are forwarded to all devices attached to the 
                      network, even if they are not interested in receiving stream data.
       &lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;br&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;
           &lt;b&gt;Multicast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           Multicasting is very similar to broadcasting. The main advantage of multicasting is that 
           multicasting saves network bandwidth, because the image data stream is only sent to those 
           devices that are interested in receiving the data. To achieve this, the camera sends image 
           data streams to members of a multicast group only. A multicast group is defined by an IP 
           address taken from the multicast address range (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255). 
           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           Every device that wants to receive a multicast data stream has to be a member of a multicast 
           group. A member of a specific multicast group only receives data destinated for this group.
           Data for other groups is not received. Usually network adapters and switches are able to filter
           the data efficently on hardware level (layer-2 packet filtering). 
           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           When multicasting is enabled for pylon, pylon automatically takes care of joining and leaving 
           the multicast groups defined by the destination IP address. Keep in mind that some addresses
           from the multicast address range are reserved for general purposes. The address range from
           239.255.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 is assigned by RFC 2365 as a locally administered address space.
           Use one of these addresses if you are not sure.
           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           On protocol level multicasting involves a so-called IGMP message (IGMP = Internet Group Management Protocol).
           To benefit from multicasting, managed network switches should be used. These managed network 
           switches support the IGMP protocol. Managed network switches supporting the IGMP protocol
           will forward multicast packets only if there is a connected device that has joined the
           corresponding multicast group. If the switch does not support the IGMP protocol, multicast
           is equivalent to broadcasting.
           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           Recommendation:&lt;br&gt;
           &lt;ul&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;
                   Each camera should stream to a different multicast group.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;
                   Streaming to different multicast groups reduces the CPU load and saves network bandwidth 
                   if the network switches supports the IGMP protocol.
               &lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;/ul&gt;
       &lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;br&gt;        
       &lt;li&gt;
           &lt;b&gt;Use camera configuration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           This setting is only available if the application has opened the device in monitor mode. If 
           the controlling application has already configured the camera stream channel and has possibly 
           started the acquisition, the monitor application can read all required configuration data 
           from the camera. Additional configuration is not required. This setting can only be used if 
           the controlling application has established the stream channel (by opening a pylon stream 
           grabber object), and the monitor application is started afterwards.
           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           Note, when using broadcast and multicast configurations: When there is more than one camera 
           device reachable by one network interface, make sure that for each camera a different port
           number must be assigned. For assigning port numbers, see the 'DestinationPort' feature.
       &lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;/ul&gt;

       Enables or disables probing of a working large packet size before grabbing.
       Using large packets reduces the overhead for transferring images but
       whether a large packet can be transported depends on the used network hardware
       and its configuration.

       An image frame consists of n numbers of packets. The packet timeout counting is (re)started
       each time a packet is received. If the timeout expires (e.g. no packet was received 
       during the last 'PacketTimeout' period), the 'Resend Packet Mechanism' is started. 
       For information, see the 'EnableResend' feature.

                <para>
       
       An image frame consists of n numbers of packets. Each packet has a header consisting of a 24-bit packet ID. 
       This packet ID increases with each packet sent, and makes it possible for the receiving end to know if a 
       particular packet has been lost during the transfer. If 'ResendPacketMechanism' is enabled, and the receiving
       end notices a lost packet, it will request the other side (e.g. the camera) to send the lost packet again.
       If enabled, the 'ResendPacketMechanism' can cause delays in the timing because the sending end will resend 
       the lost packet. If disabled, image data packet(s) can get lost which results in an incomplete received frame.
       You have to weigh the disadvantages and advantages for your special application to decide whether to enable 
       or disable this command.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

            <summary>Selects the matrix color transformation between color spaces.
Generally, the related color spaces are used for internal processing: The color signals provided by the sensor are transformed to the RGB color space to allow further transformations (to account for the type of light source, for color adjustment, for white balance, etc.).
The color transformation selected here does not refer to the color space selected for the transmission of image data out of the camera.

       The default value is appropriate for most applications. 
       Reducing the value may cause a higher CPU load. USB host adapter drivers may require 
       to decrease the value in case the application fails to receive the image stream. The maximum value 
       for the Maximum Transfer Size depends on the operating system version and may be limited by the host adapter drivers.

            <summary>Selects the matrix color transformation between color spaces.
Generally, the related color spaces are used for internal processing: The color signals provided by the sensor are transformed to the RGB color space to allow further transformations (to account for the type of light source, for color adjustment, for white balance, etc.).
The color transformation selected here does not refer to the color space selected for the transmission of image data out of the camera.

                <para>The Inter-line Delay Abs parameter sets the delay between the end of transmission of a line and the start of transmission of the next line.
The parameter sets a floating point value to express the delay in microseconds. The set value will be automatically adjusted to the nearest value that can be expressed as a multiple of the period of the currently selected pixel clock. The line valid signal (LVAL) remains low during the set delay.
The default value of the parameter is the minimum allowed inter-line delay.</para>

            <summary>Selects the matrix color transformation between color spaces.
Generally, the related color spaces are used for internal processing: The color signals provided by the sensor are transformed to the RGB color space to allow further transformations (to account for the type of light source, for color adjustment, for white balance, etc.).
The color transformation selected here does not refer to the color space selected for the transmission of image data out of the camera.

            &lt;b&gt;Default (Unicast)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            The camera sends stream data to a single controlling application. Other devices cannot
            receive the stream data.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;Broadcast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            The camera sends the stream data to all devices on the network. The application which 
            starts/stops the acquisition is called the controlling application. Other applications
            can receive the stream data. These applications are called monitor applications, because 
            they open the camera in read-only mode. This implies that monitor applications cannot 
            change the camera configuration and they cannot start/stop the image acquisition.
            However, monitor applications can request resend requests for lost stream data packets.
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Attention: Broadcasting the stream data packets uses a high amount of network bandwidth 
                       because the stream data packets are forwarded to all devices attached to the 
                       network, even if they are not interested in receiving stream data.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;Multicast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Multicasting is very similar to broadcasting. The main advantage of multicasting is that 
            multicasting saves network bandwidth, because the image data stream is only sent to those 
            devices that are interested in receiving the data. To achieve this, the camera sends image 
            data streams to members of a multicast group only. A multicast group is defined by an IP 
            address taken from the multicast address range (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255). 
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Every device that wants to receive a multicast data stream has to be a member of a multicast 
            group. A member of a specific multicast group only receives data destinated for this group.
            Data for other groups is not received. Usually network adapters and switches are able to filter
            the data efficently on hardware level (layer-2 packet filtering). 
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            When multicasting is enabled for pylon, pylon automatically takes care of joining and leaving 
            the multicast groups defined by the destination IP address. Keep in mind that some addresses
            from the multicast address range are reserved for general purposes. The address range from
            239.255.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 is assigned by RFC 2365 as a locally administered address space.
            Use one of these addresses if you are not sure.
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            On protocol level multicasting involves a so-called IGMP message (IGMP = Internet Group Management Protocol).
            To benefit from multicasting, managed network switches should be used. These managed network 
            switches support the IGMP protocol. Managed network switches supporting the IGMP protocol
            will forward multicast packets only if there is a connected device that has joined the
            corresponding multicast group. If the switch does not support the IGMP protocol, multicast
            is equivalent to broadcasting.
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Recommendation:&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    Each camera should stream to a different multicast group.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    Streaming to different multicast groups reduces the CPU load and saves network bandwidth 
                    if the network switches supports the IGMP protocol.
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;        
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;Use camera configuration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            This setting is only available if the application has opened the device in monitor mode. If 
            the controlling application has already configured the camera stream channel and has possibly 
            started the acquisition, the monitor application can read all required configuration data 
            from the camera. Additional configuration is not required. This setting can only be used if 
            the controlling application has established the stream channel (by opening a pylon stream 
            grabber object), and the monitor application is started afterwards.
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Note, when using broadcast and multicast configurations: When there is more than one camera 
            device reachable by one network interface, make sure that for each camera a different port
            number must be assigned. For assigning port numbers, see the 'DestinationPort' feature.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;b&gt;Default (Unicast)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            The camera sends stream data to a single controlling application. Other devices cannot
            receive the stream data.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;Broadcast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            The camera sends the stream data to all devices on the network. The application which 
            starts/stops the acquisition is called the controlling application. Other applications
            can receive the stream data. These applications are called monitor applications, because 
            they open the camera in read-only mode. This implies that monitor applications cannot 
            change the camera configuration and they cannot start/stop the image acquisition.
            However, monitor applications can request resend requests for lost stream data packets.
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Attention: Broadcasting the stream data packets uses a high amount of network bandwidth 
                       because the stream data packets are forwarded to all devices attached to the 
                       network, even if they are not interested in receiving stream data.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;Multicast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Multicasting is very similar to broadcasting. The main advantage of multicasting is that 
            multicasting saves network bandwidth, because the image data stream is only sent to those 
            devices that are interested in receiving the data. To achieve this, the camera sends image 
            data streams to members of a multicast group only. A multicast group is defined by an IP 
            address taken from the multicast address range (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255). 
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Every device that wants to receive a multicast data stream has to be a member of a multicast 
            group. A member of a specific multicast group only receives data destinated for this group.
            Data for other groups is not received. Usually network adapters and switches are able to filter
            the data efficently on hardware level (layer-2 packet filtering). 
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            When multicasting is enabled for pylon, pylon automatically takes care of joining and leaving 
            the multicast groups defined by the destination IP address. Keep in mind that some addresses
            from the multicast address range are reserved for general purposes. The address range from
            239.255.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 is assigned by RFC 2365 as a locally administered address space.
            Use one of these addresses if you are not sure.
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            On protocol level multicasting involves a so-called IGMP message (IGMP = Internet Group Management Protocol).
            To benefit from multicasting, managed network switches should be used. These managed network 
            switches support the IGMP protocol. Managed network switches supporting the IGMP protocol
            will forward multicast packets only if there is a connected device that has joined the
            corresponding multicast group. If the switch does not support the IGMP protocol, multicast
            is equivalent to broadcasting.
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Recommendation:&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    Each camera should stream to a different multicast group.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    Streaming to different multicast groups reduces the CPU load and saves network bandwidth 
                    if the network switches supports the IGMP protocol.
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;        
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;Use camera configuration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            This setting is only available if the application has opened the device in monitor mode. If 
            the controlling application has already configured the camera stream channel and has possibly 
            started the acquisition, the monitor application can read all required configuration data 
            from the camera. Additional configuration is not required. This setting can only be used if 
            the controlling application has established the stream channel (by opening a pylon stream 
            grabber object), and the monitor application is started afterwards.
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Note, when using broadcast and multicast configurations: When there is more than one camera 
            device reachable by one network interface, make sure that for each camera a different port
            number must be assigned. For assigning port numbers, see the 'DestinationPort' feature.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

        The default value is appropriate for most applications. 
        Reducing the value may cause a higher CPU load. USB host adapter drivers may require

      An image frame consists of n numbers of packets. The 'FrameRetention' always starts from the
      point in time the receiving end notices that a packet has been received for a particular frame. 
      If the transmission of packets of a frame is not completed within the 'FrameRetention' time, 
      the corresponding frame is delivered with status 'Failed'.

                <para>
        
        An image frame consists of n numbers of packets. Each packet has a header consisting of a 24-bit packet ID. 
        This packet ID increases with each packet sent, and makes it possible for the receiving end to know if a 
        particular packet has been lost during the transfer. If 'ResendPacketMechanism' is enabled, and the receiving
        end notices a lost packet, it will request the other side (e.g. the camera) to send the lost packet again.
        If enabled, the 'ResendPacketMechanism' can cause delays in the timing because the sending end will resend 
        the lost packet. If disabled, image data packet(s) can get lost which results in an incomplete received frame.
        You have to weigh the disadvantages and advantages for your special application to decide whether to enable 
        or disable this command.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

            The camera will send all stream data to this port. If you manually enter a port
            number, it is highly recommended not to choose a port from the ephemeral port
            range of the operating system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port)
            in order to avoid port collisions.

            &lt;b&gt;Port configuration:&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;Unicast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                The port is determined automatically.
                Manually choosing a port number might be useful for certain firewall configurations.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;Broadcast &amp; Multicast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                For each device reachable by a specific network interface, a unique, unused port number
                must be assigned. Be aware that the suggested default value might be already in use.
                Choose an unused port or 0=autoselect in that case. The controlling application and all 
                monitor applications must use the same port number. There is no autoselect feature
                availbale for monitor applications, i.e., monitor applications must not use the 0 value.
                For monitor applications it is convenient to use the 'UseCameraConfig' value for the 
                'TransmissionType' feature instead. For more details see the 'TransmissionType' feature.

        Using large packets reduces the overhead for transferring images but

All input image formats can be converted to all output image formats.</para>
                <para>RGB, BGR and Bayer image formats are converted to monochrome formats by using the following formula:

<code language="cpp">
mono = (0.25 * red) + (0.625 * green) + (0.125 * blue);
</code>

YUV formats are converted to 16 bit bit depth in an intermediate conversion step. This is why the output
is always aligned at the most significant bit when converting to 16 bit color output formats like RGB16packed.
</para>
                <para> Limitations:
The last column of an YUV input image with odd width cannot be converted.
The last column and the last row of a Bayer input image cannot be converted.

The default treatment of rows and columns that cannot be converted due to their location on edges
can be controlled using the @PixelDataConverter/InconvertibleEdgeHandling parameter.
For more information, see the Convert() method description.

If required, the image is automatically converted to a new image and then saved.
An image with a bit depth higher than 8 bit is stored with 16 bit bit depth
if supported by the image file format. In this case, the pixel data is MSB aligned.

If more control over the conversion is required, the <see cref="T:Basler.Pylon.PixelDataConverter" /> class
can be used to convert the input image before saving it.

Sets an alternative buffer factory that is used for buffer allocation.
</summary>
            <remarks>
                <para>
The use of this property is optional and intended for advanced use cases only.

If nullptr is passed as buffer factory then the default buffer factory is used.
Buffers are allocated when <see cref="M:Basler.Pylon.IStreamGrabber.Start(Basler.Pylon.GrabStrategy,Basler.Pylon.GrabLoop)" /> is called.
A buffer factory must not be disposed while it is attached to the stream grabber object
and it must not be disposed until the last buffer is freed. To free all buffers
the grab needs to be stopped and all grab results must be released or destroyed.

Grabbing single images using a software trigger (see <see cref="M:Basler.Pylon.Configuration.SoftwareTrigger(System.Object,System.EventArgs)" />) is recommended if you want to maximize frame rate.
This is because the overhead per grabbed image is reduced compared to single frame acquisition (see <see cref="M:Basler.Pylon.Configuration.AcquireSingleFrame(System.Object,System.EventArgs)" />).
The grabbing can be started using <see cref="M:Basler.Pylon.IStreamGrabber.Start(Basler.Pylon.GrabStrategy,Basler.Pylon.GrabLoop)" />.

Other grabbed images are skipped. This strategy can be used if the application does not retrieve all images in time.
The PLCameraInstance.OutputQueueSize parameter can be used to control how many images can be queued in the output queue.
When setting the output queue size to PLCameraInstance.MaxNumBuffer, this strategy is equivalent to GrabStrategy_OneByOne.
This strategy can be used for displaying images or any other use cases that do not require to process every single image,
e.g. some barcode scanning use cases.
By setting PLCameraInstance.OutputQueueSize to 1 and PLCameraInstance.MaxNumBuffer to 2 only a few buffers are required
and if the images cannot be displayed/processed fast enough older images are automatically discarded.
Note that the number buffers set need to be chosen depending on the actual use case.

Interface of the grab result data.
</summary>
            <remarks>
                <para>
The grab result controls the reuse and the lifetime of the referenced pixel data buffer.
If the original and all cloned grab results referencing a pixel data buffer are disposed,
the pixel data buffer is freed or reused by the camera stream grabber (depending on the used buffer type).
The data and the pixel data buffer are still valid after the original camera object has been disposed.

The grab result interface is derived from <see cref="T:Basler.Pylon.IImage" />. The IImage interface provides the property <see cref="P:Basler.Pylon.IImage.IsValid" />.
The grab result is considered a valid image if the <see cref="P:Basler.Pylon.IImage.PixelTypeValue" /> is defined and

            <param name="image">The interface of the image.</param>
            <returns>Returns the stride of the image in bytes. Returns null if the stride cannot be computed.</returns>
            <remarks>
                <para>
The stride indicates the distance in bytes from the beginning of one image row to the beginning of the next row.
For planar pixel types, the returned value represents the stride of a plane.
</para>
                <para>
The stride in bytes cannot be computed for packed image format when the stride is not byte aligned and paddingX == 0.
If paddingX is larger than zero and the stride without padding is not byte aligned, the rest of the partially
filled byte is considered as padding. For example, if padding is set to 10, pixelType is PixelType_Mono12packed,
   and the image width is 5, the stride without padding is 12 * 5 = 60 bits = 7.5 bytes.
The remaining 0.5 are considered as padding, which results in a stride of 18 bytes.

            <remarks>
                <para>
Every parameter collection has a main parameter path. When looking up parameters of the main path, the path can be omitted.
The definition of a main parameter path depends on the source of the related parameter collection.
For simplicity, a combination of path, name, and type is referred to as parameter name, analogous to file names.

                <para>
Some parameter values are cached, e.g. to minimize the overhead while communicating with a camera device.
You can call this method to force an invalidation of the cached values.
On the next read of the parameter, the value will be read from the source instead of returning a cached value.
This will raise a ParameterChanged event.
This method can be used to reread the value in the ParameterChanged event handler.
