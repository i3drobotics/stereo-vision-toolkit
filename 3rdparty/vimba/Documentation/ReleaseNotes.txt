---------------------
Hardware Requirements
---------------------
PC or laptop with 1 GHz 32-bit or 64-bit x86 processor or better.

Allied Vision IEEE 1394 cameras:
A built-in IEEE 1394 interface or IEEE 1394 adapter (OHCI) card (one or more) 
for PCI or PCI Express bus or PC card or ExpressCard with IEEE 1394 port(s) 
is required.

  Remark:
  Testing has been performed on host controllers that are based on OHCI chip
  sets from Texas Instruments. The driver should run on host controllers that
  are based on OHCI chip sets from other vendors, too.
  However, if there are any problems please feel free to contact our Technical
  Software Support (see below).


Allied Vision GigE cameras: 
A built-in Gigabit Ethernet network interface or Gigabit Ethernet network 
card (one or more) is required.

  Note for IP configuration:
  By default, IP Configuration Mode is set to DHCP. 
  You can also select LLA (link-local address) if you connect just one camera. 
  If multiple cameras are connected at the same time, we recommend using 
  DHCP or Persistent IP Address to enable discovery of all cameras.


Allied Vision USB cameras: 
  A built-in USB 3.0 controller for PCI Express bus is required.

  Remark:
  Testing has been performed on host controllers that are based on Intel chip
  sets and Renesas chip sets. The driver may run on host controllers that
  are based on chip sets from other vendors, too. Nevertheless for best
  performance we highly recommend Intel chip sets.
  However, if there are any problems please feel free to contact our Technical
  Software Support (see below).

Allied Vision Camera Link (Goldeye CL) cameras:
  Please read the document "Usage of Frame grabbers with Goldeye CL Cameras"
  https://www.alliedvision.com/en/support/technical-documentation/goldeye-gcl-documentation

---------------------------
Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------
Vimba is designed for the 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems:

  Windows 7
  Windows 8.1
  Windows 10 (tested with versions 1803, 1809, and 1903)


------------
Installation
------------
Please refer to section "Correlations with other Allied Vision Software
Packages" further down in this file if you plan to use other Allied Vision
software packages in parallel with Vimba.

To install Vimba, simply run the setup by starting the Vimba.exe and follow
the instructions shown on the screen.

For the installation of Vimba, .NET Framework 2.0 SP2, .NET Framework 3.5 SP1,
or .NET Framework 4.x is required.

Windows drivers are signed with sha256 due to new Microsoft requirements.
To use the driver on Windows 7, install "Security Update for Windows 7 KB3033929"

------------
Known Issues
------------
Setup:
  - During installation, Vimba setup configures some environment
    variables that are - among others - used when compiling the examples. In
    order to use the new environment variables, it might be necessary to restart
    Microsoft Visual Studio, log off, or even restart the operating system.
  - When modifying Vimba installation through the setup, it is not possible
    to change the examples installation folder, even if examples have not been
    installed before. Please make sure to set the examples installation folder
    during the first time installation.

GigE Filter Driver:
  - Disabling the Vimba GigE Filter Driver while it is in use might lead to
    unexpected behavior up to blue screen.
  - Using other filter drivers additionally to Vimba's GigE Filter Driver may cause issues.

GigE Transport Layer:
  - A change of the available camera access modes cannot be reported for cameras
    in different subnets or with malconfigured IP addresses. These cameras can
    be accessed in configuration mode from different hosts simultaneously.

Vimba 1394 Transport Layer:
  - The Vimba 1394 Transport Layer module supports most of the features
    implemented in Allied Vision's 1394 cameras. Please contact Allied Vision in
    case you require a feature that is currently not supported.

Cognex Adapter:
  - Under Windows 8, Cognex has to be run as administrator in order to find the
    Vimba Cognex Adapter.
  
Vimba Viewer:
   - When multiple opened GigE cameras are disconnected at the same time
     while no other camera stays connected to the very same NIC,
     the Vimba Viewer's camera windows stay open.

Correlations with other Allied Vision Software Packages
-------------------------------------------------------
- AVT FirePackage
  If you plan to use the AVT FirePackage in parallel with Vimba, please make
  sure to install the AVT FirePackage v3.1 (or higher) first!
  Removing Vimba might break the AVT FirePackage installation. In that case
  you should start the AVT FirePackage installer again and click on "Repair".

- AVT FirePackage64
  If you already installed AVT FirePackage64, please uninstall it before
  installing Vimba. If you plan to use the AVT FirePackage for 64-bit
  operating systems please use AVT FirePackage v3.1 (or higher) which is
  designed for both, 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems.

- AVT Universal Package
  The AVT Universal Package (v2.1) cannot be used in parallel with Vimba.
  However they can be installed on the same machine, but switching between
  the two packages requires to issue a "Repair". So if you want to switch
  to the AVT Universal Package you should start the AVT Universal Package
  installer and click on "Repair" and switching to Vimba requires to start
  Vimba installer and click on "Repair".
  Removing Vimba might break the AVT Universal Package (v2.1) installation.
  In that case you should start the AVT Universal Package installer again
  and click on "Repair".
